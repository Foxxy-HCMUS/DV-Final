# DV-Final
This is the final project of the Data Visualization Course, where we visualized time-use survey data in Tableau, building interactive dashboards to analyze trends in time spent on work, leisure, and sleep across demographics. Additionally, we performed statistical analysis on salary, job categories, and salary levels.
